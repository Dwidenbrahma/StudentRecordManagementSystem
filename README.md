# Student Record Management System

A **C++ menu-driven application** designed primarily to demonstrate the **implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** along with file handling for persistent storage.

---

## 📌 Overview

The **main purpose** of this project is to apply and strengthen my understanding of:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **File Handling in C++**

The system allows managing student records with basic CRUD operations (currently Add & View), and is built in a modular and scalable way for future enhancements.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice **OOP principles** such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- Implement **persistent storage** using text files.
- Create a user-friendly **menu-driven program** for managing student records.

---

## ✨ Features

- **OOP-based architecture** for clean and maintainable code.
- **Persistent storage** to retain data after program termination.
- Add new student records with unique ID validation.
- View student details by **Student ID**.
- Simple and interactive terminal-based interface.
